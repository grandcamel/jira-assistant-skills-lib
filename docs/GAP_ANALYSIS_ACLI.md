**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Reference:** https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/acli/reference/commands/#acli

## Executive Summary

| Metric | Atlassian ACLI | jira-as |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Total JIRA Commands | ~41 | **165+** |
| Command Categories | 8 | **13** |
| Coverage Status | Baseline | **Superset** |

**Key Finding:** This library is a **superset** of ACLI functionality with approximately 4x more commands. However, there are **5 specific gaps** where ACLI has capabilities this library lacks.

## Gaps: ACLI Features Missing from This Library

### Summary Table

| # | ACLI Command | Description | Priority | Effort |
|---|--------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | `jira workitem archive` | Archive/soft-delete issues | Medium | Low |
| 2 | `jira workitem unarchive` | Restore archived issues | Medium | Low |
| 3 | `jira dashboard search` | Search dashboards | Low | Low |
| 4 | `jira field delete` | Delete custom fields | Medium | Low |
| 5 | `jira field cancel-delete` | Cancel pending field deletion | Low | Low |
| 6 | `jira filter change-owner` | Transfer filter ownership | Low | Low |

### Detailed Gap Analysis

#### 1. Issue Archive/Unarchive

**ACLI Commands:**
- `jira workitem archive` - Soft-delete issues without permanent removal
- `jira workitem unarchive` - Restore previously archived issues

**Current State:**
- Library has `archive_project()` and `restore_project()` in `jira_client.py:5317-5357`
- No equivalent methods for individual issues

**REST API Endpoints:**
```
PUT  /rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/archive
PUT  /rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/unarchive
POST /rest/api/3/issue/archive  (bulk archive)
```

**Note:** Issue archiving is a JIRA Premium feature.

**Implementation Required:**
- Add `archive_issue()` method to `JiraClient`
- Add `unarchive_issue()` method to `JiraClient`
- Add `jira-as issue archive ISSUE-KEY` CLI command
- Add `jira-as issue unarchive ISSUE-KEY` CLI command
- Add mock implementations in `mock/base.py`

---

#### 2. Dashboard Operations

**ACLI Commands:**
- `jira dashboard search` - Find dashboards by criteria

**Current State:**
- Library has zero dashboard functionality
- No `dashboard` command group in CLI

**REST API Endpoints:**
```
GET /rest/api/3/dashboard/search
GET /rest/api/3/dashboard/{dashboardId}
GET /rest/api/3/dashboard/{dashboardId}/gadget
```

**Implementation Required:**
- Add dashboard methods to `JiraClient`:
  - `search_dashboards()`
  - `get_dashboard()`
  - `get_dashboard_gadgets()`
- Add `jira-as dashboard` command group
- Add mock implementations

---

#### 3. Field Delete Operations

**ACLI Commands:**
- `jira field delete` - Delete custom fields
- `jira field cancel-delete` - Cancel a pending field deletion

**Current State:**
- Library has `delete_field_option()` for deleting field options (mock/mixins/fields.py:736)
- No top-level field delete capability

**REST API Endpoints:**
```
DELETE /rest/api/3/field/{fieldId}
POST   /rest/api/3/field/{fieldId}/restore
```

**Implementation Required:**
- Add `delete_field()` method to `JiraClient`
- Add `cancel_delete_field()` method to `JiraClient`
- Add `jira-as fields delete FIELD-ID` CLI command
- Add `jira-as fields cancel-delete FIELD-ID` CLI command
- Add mock implementations

---

#### 4. Filter Change-Owner

**ACLI Commands:**
- `jira filter change-owner` - Transfer filter ownership to another user

**Current State:**
- Library has comprehensive filter operations:
  - `create_filter()`, `get_filter()`, `update_filter()`, `delete_filter()`
  - `add_filter_favourite()`, `remove_filter_favourite()`
  - `get_filter_permissions()`, `add_filter_permission()`, `delete_filter_permission()`
- Missing: ownership transfer capability

**REST API Endpoint:**
```
PUT /rest/api/3/filter/{id}/owner
```

**Implementation Required:**
- Add `change_filter_owner()` method to `JiraClient`
- Add `jira-as search filter change-owner FILTER-ID --to USER` CLI command
- Add mock implementation

## Feature Parity Matrix

| ACLI Category | ACLI Commands | Library Status | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| **auth** | login, logout, status, switch | ✅ Equivalent | Via env vars, keychain, config files |
| **board** | list-sprints, search | ✅ Superset | + backlog, velocity, ranking |
| **dashboard** | search | ❌ **Missing** | No dashboard support |
| **field** | create, delete, cancel-delete | ⚠️ Partial | Has create, missing delete operations |
| **filter** | list, search, add-favourite, change-owner | ⚠️ Partial | Missing change-owner only |
| **project** | create, list, view, update, archive, delete, restore | ✅ Superset | + categories, avatars, components |
| **sprint** | list-workitems | ✅ Superset | + create, start, close, update |

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Add issue archive/unarchive** - Common operation for issue lifecycle management
2. **Add field delete operations** - Complete field management capability

### Medium Priority
3. **Add dashboard search** - Useful for dashboard discovery
4. **Add filter change-owner** - Complete filter management

### Low Priority
5. Consider adding more dashboard operations (gadgets, configuration) if user demand exists
